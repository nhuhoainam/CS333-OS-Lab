Question 1:
usertrap() function called `syscall`.

Question 2:
The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 0x7.
This value represents the system call number for SYS_exec. (defined in syscall.h)

Question 3:
sstatus = 0x22 (0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010 0010)
The 8th bit of sstatus is SPP, which is 0. This means that the previous privilege mode is user mode.

Question 4:
The assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at is:
    800020d6:	00002903          	lw	s2,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
Register s2 corresponds to the variable num.

Question 5:
The address 0 is not mapped in the kernel's address space. This is shown by the scause, which stands for page fault caused by a read.

Question 6:
The name of the binary that was running when the kernel panicked is `initcode`.
Its process id is 1.
